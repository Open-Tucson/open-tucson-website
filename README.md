# open-tucson-website
## Website for the Open Tucson organization.

This is the website for Open Tucson, an IRS designated 501(c)(3) educational and community organization. Code for Tucson, the Code for America Brigade in Tucson, Arizona, was reorgnized as Open Tucson after Code for America shut down the Brigade Network in 2023. In the process of reorganizing, we felt it would be worthwhile to shift Open Tucson's focus from the "civic hacking" focus of Code for America to a broader embrace of open source: open data, open hardware, and open software.

Because of that shift in focus, this website has been built completely from standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks have their place and simplify development, but they also have issues of being deprecated or having their licenses changed. To avoid that as much as possible, we avoided using frameworks.
